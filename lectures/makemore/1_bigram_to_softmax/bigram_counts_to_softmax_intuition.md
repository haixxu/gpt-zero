Here's a deeper, layered intuition pass that often “makes it click” for people, moving from concrete counting to the neural (softmax) view. Skim top‑down; dive where it still feels fuzzy.

## 1. What the Count Matrix N Really Is
Think of `N` as a giant tally sheet (27 rows = “current char”, 27 columns = “next char”).  
Row `i` contains how many times each possible next character followed character `i` in the data.  
Row normalization turns raw frequencies into conditional probabilities:  
$P_{i,j} = \dfrac{N_{i,j}}{\sum_k N_{i,k}} = p(\text{next}=j \mid \text{current}=i)$.

That’s the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) for a categorical distribution per row.

## 2. The Neural Layer: W is Just a Soft, Learnable N (in log space)
A linear layer with one-hot inputs doesn’t “mix” features; it just selects rows.

- Input one-hot vector for current char `i`: `x = e_i` (a vector of all zeros except a 1 at position `i`).
- Linear layer without bias: `logits = x @ W` picks row `i` of `W`.
- So row `i` of `W` contains 27 real-valued scores for “how plausible each next char is after char i”.

Softmax then converts those 27 real scores into a probability distribution, exactly like normalizing a row of counts.

## 3. Why Exponent + Normalize? (Softmax = Learned Row Normalization)
Softmax over a row:
$$p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{w_{i,j}}}{\sum_{k} e^{w_{i,k}}}.$$
Compare to the counts model:
$$P_{i,j} = \frac{N_{i,j}}{\sum_k N_{i,k}}.$$
If you choose $w_{i,j} = \log N_{i,j}$ (or `log (N_{i,j}+1)` for smoothing) then
$$p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{\log N_{i,j}}}{\sum_k e^{\log N_{i,k}}} = \frac{N_{i,j}}{\sum_k N_{i,k}} = P_{i,j}.$$
So the neural model can exactly replicate the empirical distribution just by setting each row of `W` to the (log) counts (plus any constant per row—see below).

## 4. Why Log Space? (Additive Freedom)
Softmax is invariant to adding the same constant to every element of a row:
$$\text{softmax}(w_{i, :}) = \text{softmax}(w_{i, :} + c_i \mathbf{1}).$$
So the true “thing that matters” is only the relative differences in a row.  
This matches counts: multiplying an entire row of `N` by a constant leaves normalized probabilities unchanged.  
Counts live naturally in the positive multiplicative world; logits live in the additive log world.

## 5. Proving the Equivalence at the Optimum
Suppose the dataset induces counts $N_{i,j}$. The (unnormalized) negative log-likelihood for just row `i` is:
$$\mathcal{L}_i = -\sum_{j} N_{i,j} \log p_{i,j}, \quad p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{w_{i,j}}}{\sum_k e^{w_{i,k}}}.$$
Differentiate w.r.t. a single logit $w_{i,j}$:
$$\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}_i}{\partial w_{i,j}} = -N_{i,j} + \Big(\sum_{k} N_{i,k}\Big) p_{i,j}.$$
Set derivative to zero at optimum:
$$p_{i,j} = \frac{N_{i,j}}{\sum_k N_{i,k}}.$$
Therefore the optimal predicted distribution equals the empirical conditional distribution.  
Any logits of the form:
$$w_{i,j} = \log N_{i,j} + c_i$$
(for any constant $c_i$ per row) give that same softmax.  
Hence training just “discovers” log-counts (up to additive row shifts) when the model capacity matches the counting model.

Add-one smoothing corresponds to pretending $N_{i,j} \mapsto N_{i,j}+1$ (so you’d initialize or bias toward $w_{i,j} \approx \log(N_{i,j}+1)$).

## 6. What the Gradient Feels Like (Local Intuition)
For a single training example whose true next char is `y` in row `i`:
- Softmax probability $p_{i,y}$ too low → gradient pushes $w_{i,y}$ up.
- All other logits in that row get nudged down a bit (because their probabilities must still sum to 1).
This is equivalent to “increment the correct count” and “implicitly re-normalize”—a differentiable analog of incrementing a cell in `N` and recomputing row probabilities.

## 7. Tiny Concrete Example (3 Symbols)
Vocabulary: `.` (0), `a` (1), `b` (2).  
Assume training bigrams after `.` are: `a, a, b` (so counts row for `.` is `[0,2,1]`).

Counts model:
- Row sum = 3 → probabilities after `.`: `[0/3, 2/3, 1/3]`.

Neural model:
1. Let row of `W` for `.` be: `w_dot = [u, v, z]`.
2. Softmax probabilities:  
   $p_a = e^{v}/(e^{u}+e^{v}+e^{z})$, etc.
3. Optimum (by derivation above) must satisfy:  
   $p_a = 2/3$, $p_b = 1/3$, $p_. = 0$ (impossible in practice unless $w_. \to -\infty$; with smoothing it becomes tiny but non-zero).
4. With add-one smoothing counts become `[1,3,2]` → smoothed probs `[1/6, 3/6, 2/6]`.  
   Set logits to their logs:  
   `w_dot = [log 1, log 3, log 2] ≈ [0, 1.0986, 0.6931]`.  
   Softmax of these gives exactly `[1/6, 3/6, 2/6]`.

This shows numerically how setting logits = log(smoothed counts) reproduces the statistical estimator.

## 8. Why Not Skip Softmax and Just Divide Raw Linear Outputs?
Linear outputs can be negative; division needs positive numbers. Softmax enforces:
- Positivity (via `exp`)
- Normalization
- Differentiability with smooth gradients (well-behaved derivatives)
- Simple analytical gradient form leading to the clean “prediction minus target” structure.

## 9. Connection to Cross-Entropy
Your loss:
$$\text{NLL} = -\frac{1}{T}\sum_{t} \log p_{t,y_t}$$
is the empirical cross-entropy between the one-hot true distribution and model distribution. Minimizing it = minimizing KL divergence from empirical distribution to model distribution. For a bigram table with full capacity, the minimum sets model distribution equal to empirical distribution (with/without smoothing depending on parameterization or priors).

## 10. Why Learning Instead of Counting if They Can Match Exactly?
Counting is a special case:
- Fixed context length (1 previous char).
- No parameter sharing: each row independent.
Learning (even with just this linear layer) opens the door to:
- Regularization (weight decay biases toward lower-magnitude logits = smoother distributions).
- Initialization from priors (e.g., start from uniform or smoothed counts).
- Extensibility: add hidden layers → context length > 1; share statistical strength across similar contexts; learn embeddings capturing similarity (e.g., vowels vs consonants).
- Differentiability through larger architectures (e.g., Transformers), where counting is impossible.

## 11. Mental Picture (Analogy)
Imagine 27 cork boards (one per current char). On each board you stick 27 Post-it notes showing how often each next char followed it. Counting physically increments those numbers. The neural model instead starts with random numbers and, each time it makes a mistake, it adjusts the involved Post-it notes (raises the correct one slightly, lowers others slightly). After enough tweaks, the relative heights of the Post-its mirror empirical frequencies. Softmax is the act of saying: “Interpret the heights as exponentiated, then normalize to get a probability distribution.”

## 12. Stabilized Softmax (Foreshadow)
Numerically stable softmax:
$$p_{i,j} = \frac{e^{w_{i,j} - m_i}}{\sum_k e^{w_{i,k} - m_i}} \quad \text{where } m_i = \max_k w_{i,k}.$$
Subtracting the max just shifts the row (remember invariance) and prevents overflow in `exp`. Exact same probabilities.

## 13. Verifying Programmatically (Optional Cell You Can Add)
You can drop this after building `N` to see equivalence:

````python
# Suppose you already built integer count matrix N with shape (27,27)
import torch

# Add-one smoothed log-count initialization
W_init = (N + 1).float().log()

# Softmax from W_init
logits = W_init              # treating each row directly as logits
probs_from_W = logits.exp() / logits.exp().sum(1, keepdims=True)

# Direct smoothed probabilities
P_smoothed = (N + 1).float()
P_smoothed /= P_smoothed.sum(1, keepdims=True)

assert torch.allclose(probs_from_W, P_smoothed)
print("Softmax(log(N+1)) exactly equals Laplace-smoothed probabilities.")
````

This is the “see it with your own eyes” confirmation that wrapping log around counts and feeding into softmax recovers the classical estimator.

## 14. Gradient Step = Tiny Recount
For a single example `(current=i, next=j)` the gradient of the loss w.r.t. `w_{i,j}` is roughly:
$$\frac{\partial \text{NLL}}{\partial w_{i,j}} = p_{i,j} - 1 \quad (\text{if } j \text{ is the true next char})$$
and for any other column `k ≠ j`:
$$\frac{\partial \text{NLL}}{\partial w_{i,k}} = p_{i,k}.$$
An SGD step subtracts those, nudging the true next char probability up, others down—mirroring an incremental recount where the correct cell weight increases its share.

## 15. What To Hold In Your Head
- Row of `W` = learnable log-counts (up to additive constant).
- Softmax = “normalize positive version of those scores” (exactly like row normalization of counts).
- Training = “adjust counts so that probability of observed bigrams increases; reduce others proportionally.”
- Optimal solution (without extra constraints) = empirical distribution.
- Power of neural approach comes when you stop feeding pure one-hots (add embeddings, context windows, hidden layers)—then you’re no longer just memorizing a table but generalizing patterns.

| Concept | Counts Model | Neural Model |
|---------|--------------|--------------|
| Parameters | Integers in `N` | Real logits in `W` |
| Smoothing | Add-one to counts | Add constant bias / prior logits |
| Normalize | Divide by row sums | Softmax row-wise |
| Update Mechanism | Increment counts | Gradient adjusts logits |
| Optimum | Empirical conditionals | Same distributions |
| Extension | Hard for longer context | Add layers / embeddings |

**Keep in head:** *A softmax layer over one-hot inputs is a learnable, smoothed, real-valued generalization of a conditional count table.*

If a specific jump still feels hand-wavy (e.g., the derivative step, the invariance, or gradient mechanics), you can now refer back to the exact section above or adapt the verification code to probe individual rows interactively.

- Increase logit for correct class (index 2) because gradient negative
- Decrease others slightly
This acts like a soft fractional re-count toward the observed outcome.
